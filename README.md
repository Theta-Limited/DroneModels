# DroneModels

[Theta](https://theta.limited/) provides a free and open source UAS geodesy platform which enables a competitive advantage for its users.

OpenAthenaâ„¢ allows common drones to spot precise geodetic locations.

An Android port of the [OpenAthena project](http://OpenAthena.com)

This repo is used to track the file droneModels.json which is bundled
across the OpenAthena application platforms.  It contains drone
CMOS/CCD specifications in order to make arbitrary point selection
more accurate.

Updates to this file will occur periodically as we test and validate
drone models and through user submissions.
