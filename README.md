# DroneModels

This repo is used to track the file droneModels.json which is bundled
across the OpenAthena application platforms.  It contains drone
CMOS/CCD specifications in order to make arbitrary point selection
more accurate.  Use the linux command-line utility jq to syntax check
the json file before you commit it.

```
% jq . droneModels.json
% echo $?
```

The exit code should be 0 if the file is syntactically correct.

## What do these values mean?

### Physical properties

Here is an example of a JSONObject for a particluar make/model of drone:
```JSON
    {
      "makeModel": "djiFC6310",
      "isThermal": false,
      "ccdWidthMMPerPixel": "12.83332/5472.0",
      "ccdHeightMMPerPixel": "8.55554/3648.0",
      "widthPixels": 5472,
      "heightPixels": 3648,
      "comment": "DJI Phantom 4 Pro, DJI Phantom 4 Advanced",
      "lensType": "perspective",
      "radialR1": 0.00298599,
      "radialR2": -0.00769116,
      "radialR3": 0.0079115,
      "tangentialT1": -0.000129713,
      "tangentialT2": 0.000221193
    }
```

In this object:
* `makeModel` represents the exif make and model String merged together, a unique String representing a specific drone model. The make String is made all lowercase, while the model string is made all uppercase.
* `focalLength` is an optional parameter which represents the distance between the focal point (the part of the lens that all light passes through) and the CCD/CMOS sensor which digitizes incoming light. This is only provided in rare cases when such data is unavailable in a camera model's image EXIF data.
* `isThermal` represents whether this particular JSONObject represents the thermal or color camera of a given drone. This is used to solve name collisions in the `makeModel` String that occur when both the thermal and color cameras of a drone report the same model name despite having different parameters.
* `ccdWidthMMPerPixel` represents the width of each pixel (in millimeters) of the drone camera's CCD/CMOS sensor which digitizes incoming light
* `ccdHeightMMPerPixel` represents the height of each pixel (in millimeters) of the drone camera's CCD/CMOS sensor which digitizes incoming light
* `widthPixels` represents the number of pixels in the width of a camera's uncropped, full resolution image
* `heightPixels` represents the number of pixels in the height of a camera's uncropped, full resolution image
* `comment` represents a comment from the author of the object which gives insight into the camera's corresponding drone model and properties
* `lensType` is one of two values: `perspective` or `fisheye`, used for applying the correct correction equations for distortion of incoming light by the camera lens. Read below for further details

### Distortion parameters

OpenAthena's basic calculation for ray angle from a selected image point is based on the [idealized pinhole camera model](https://towardsdatascience.com/camera-intrinsic-matrix-with-example-in-python-d79bf2478c12?gi=8bd7b436d2d3). This model makes no consideration of the properties of the actual camera lens, which introduces its own image distortion subtly different than may be expected by the pinhole camera model. These distortions may be [especially pronounced with zoom lenses at larger focal lengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_(optics))

If calibration data (based on real-world calibration with a particular camera model) is present, OpenAthena may use certain parameters to apply a mathematical correction for the distortion a particular camera lens causes. This allows the calculated ray angle for an arbitrary image point to be more accurate.

These two links describe the applicable mathematical formulas:
https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/202559089-How-are-the-Internal-and-External-Camera-Parameters-defined
https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/camera-calibration.html#:~:text=The%20intrinsic%20parameters%20represent%20the,plane%20using%20the%20intrinsics%20parameters.

The type correction applied depends on whether the `lensType` is either `perspective` or `fisheye`.

`perspective` cameras have the parameters `radialR1`, `radialR2`, `radialR3`, `tangentialT1`, and tangentialT2`, and such an JSONObject may look like this:
```JSON
    {
      "makeModel": "djiL2D-20C",
      "isThermal": false,
      "ccdWidthMMPerPixel": "17.902472/5280.0",
      "ccdHeightMMPerPixel": "13.357522/3956.0",
      "widthPixels": 5280,
      "heightPixels": 3956,
      "comment": "DJI Mavic 3 Main Hasselblad Camera",
      "lensType": "perspective",
      "radialR1": 0.0044647,
      "radialR2": -0.00549164,
      "radialR3": 0.0246166,
      "tangentialT1": -0.000468935,
      "tangentialT2": -0.000564484
    }

```

`fisheye` cameras have the parameters `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f`, and such an JSONObject may look like this:
```JSON
    {
      "makeModel": "parrotBEBOP 2",
      "isThermal": false,
      "ccdWidthMMPerPixel": "5.7344/4096.0",
      "ccdHeightMMPerPixel": "4.648/3072.0",
      "widthPixels": 4096,
      "heightPixels": 3072,
      "comment": "1/2.3in 14 MP unnamed sensor",
      "lensType": "fisheye",
      "c": 1101.96,
      "d": 0.0,
      "e": 0.0,
      "f": 1101.96
    }
```

## Contributing new drone models

Updates to this file will occur periodically as we test and validate
drone models and through user submissions.

### Calibrate parameters for a new drone model

To begin calibrating your particular drone model, you will first need to determine the `ccdWidthMMPerPixel` and `ccdHeightMMPerPixel`. This can often be determined from technical specification documents of a camera if the exact model of its CCD/CMOS sensor is known (commonly products made by Sony or FLIR). If the particular sensor model is not known, please contact developer support for your drone's manufacturer.

From there, follow these instructions using the unaffiliated PIX4D software to calculate calibrations for your particular drone:
https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/206065716-How-to-calibrate-a-Perspective-Lens-Camera

After calibration, all the necessary data will be available in the PIX4D `icmdb.xml` file, the location on your filesystem described here:
https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/202559349-Which-Cameras-exist-in-PIX4Dmapper-Database-and-which-Parameters-are-used

Finally, convert the data from the PIX4D format to the OpenAthena JSONObject convention shown previously. Rename `radialK1` to `radialR1`, `radialK2` to `radialR2`, and `radialK3` to `radialR3`.

### Contribute your parameters to this project

We welcome third party contributions, especially from drone manufactuers who would like to enhance the compatibility and accuracy of their products with OpenAthena.

To contribute, make a fork of this repo and clone your fork. Insert your new JSONObject to the `droneCCDParams` array in `droneModels.json`. Install [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) if it is not already on your system, and run the command described previously to check for syntax errors. Add and commit your changes, and push it to your fork. Finally, use the GitHub web interface to create a pull request to request your fork's changes to be merged into this repository. In your pull request message, please describe your drone model and the process you used to perform calibration.
